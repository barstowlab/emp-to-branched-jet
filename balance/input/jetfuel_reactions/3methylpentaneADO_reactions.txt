CO2 + H2O → HCO3- + Hplus
ATP + Propionyl-CoA + HCO3- → ADP + Orthophosphate + (S)-Methylmalonyl-CoA
ATP + Acetyl-CoA + HCO3- → ADP + Orthophosphate + Malonyl-CoA
Acetyl-CoA + (S)-Methylmalonyl-CoA → 3-methyl-Acetoacetyl-CoA + CO2 + CoA
3-methyl-Acetoacetyl-CoA + NADPH + Hplus → 3R-3-methyl-3-Hydroxybutanoyl-CoA + NADPplus
3R-3-methyl-3-Hydroxybutanoyl-CoA → 3-methyl-But-2-enoyl-CoA + H2O
3-methyl-But-2-enoyl-CoA + NADPH + Hplus → 3-methyl-Butanoyl-CoA + NADPplus
Malonyl-CoA + 3-methyl-Butanoyl-CoA → CoA + CO2 + 3-methyl-Oxohexanoyl-CoA
3-methyl-Oxohexanoyl-CoA + NADH + Hplus → S-3-methyl-Hydroxyhexanoyl-CoA + NADplus
S-3-methyl-Hydroxyhexanoyl-CoA → 3-methyl-trans-hex-2-enoyl-CoA + H2O
3-methyl-trans-hex-2-enoyl-CoA + NADPH + Hplus → 3-methyl-Hexanoyl-CoA + NADPplus
3-methyl-Hexanoyl-CoA + NADH + Hplus → CoA + 3-methyl-Hexanal + NADplus
3-methyl-Hexanal + Oxygen + 2*NADPH + 2*Hplus → 3-methyl-Pentane + Formate + H2O + 2*NADPplus
Formate → CO2 + NADH + Hplus
NADH + NADPplus → NADPH + NADplus
